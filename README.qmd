## Overview

`Logônia` is a [NetLogo](https://www.netlogo.org) model for simulating the growth response of a fictional plant species named Logônia (*netlogia brasiliensis*) to different climatic conditions. The model incorporates climate data from [WorldClim 2.1](https://worldclim.org/) and serves as fun example on how to integrate the [`LogoClim`](https://github.com/sustentarea/logoclim) model into other NetLogo models using the NetLogo [`LevelSpace`](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/ls.html) extension.

## How It Works

`Logônia` operates on a grid of patches, where each patch represents the soil in which the logônia plant species grow. Each patch corresponds to a specific geographic area and stores historical values of different climate variables.

![Logônia Sizes](images/logonia-sizes.svg)

The model was created to serve as an example of integration of climate data from [WorldClim 2.1](https://worldclim.org/) using the [`LogoClim`](https://github.com/sustentarea/logoclim) NetLogo model. The climate data influences the growth of the species, adding a layer of complexity to the simulation.

The data comes from [WorldClim 2.1](https://worldclim.org/) *Historical Monthly Weather Data* series (1951-2024) ([Fick & Hijmans, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.5086)) for a selected region of the **Amazon forest**. The variables include *average minimum temperature (°C)* (**A**), *average maximum temperature (°C)* (**B**), and *total precipitation (mm)* (**C**). The data can be reproduced with the Quarto notebooks in the `qmd` folder of this repository, adapted from those provided by the [`LogoClim`](https://github.com/sustentarea/logoclim) model.

Refer to the `Info` tab in the model for additional details.

## How to Use It

### Setup

To get started, ensure you have [NetLogo](https://www.netlogo.org) installed. This model was developed using NetLogo 7.0.0, so it is recommended to use this version or later.

The model relies on the `LevelSpace` ([`ls`](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/ls.html)) and `String` ([`string`](https://github.com/NetLogo/String-Extension)) NetLogo extension, these are automatically installed when the model is run for the first time.

#### Downloading the Model

You can download the latest release of the model from its [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/sustentarea/logonia/releases/latest). For the development version, you can clone or download this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sustentarea/logonia/) directly.

```{=gfm}
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Download all repository files, not only the `nlogox` folder.
```

#### Running the Model

Once everything is set, open the `logonia.nlogox` file located in the `nlogox` folder to start exploring!

Refer to the `Info` tab in the model for additional details.
