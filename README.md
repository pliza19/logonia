3. Browse to the location of the logonia model file, usually located in the installation folder (or where extra files were extracted).
4. Click on the logonia model to open it.

### 🔍 Exploring the Model

Once inside NetLogo, you can use the following features:

- Adjust parameters related to climate change and plant growth.
- Run simulations to observe how plants respond to changing conditions.
- Analyze the data generated for better understanding.

## 📈 Example Use Case

Suppose you want to explore how drought affects plant growth. You can adjust variables like rainfall frequency and temperature, then run the simulation to see the potential impacts on plant health and population. This makes logonia a fantastic tool for students and researchers in environmental sciences, agriculture, and climate studies.

## 📐 Additional Features

Here are some useful features that logonia offers:

- **Agent-Based Modeling:** Observe how individual plants react to changes over time.
- **Visual Output:** Use graphs and maps to visualize plant growth and environmental impacts.
- **Data Export:** Save simulation results for further analysis and reporting.
